I am most interested in exploring economic development and sports analytics. For the former, I would like to examine 
the prevalence of monopolies and their effect on countries' economic development over the past few decades. I would use data from the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Data) or the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). For the latter topic, I would be interested to look at the effect that different salary cap structures have a competition across different sports leagues, using data from [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com/).
